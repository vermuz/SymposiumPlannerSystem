OOJREW AGENT TEST TOOL
=====================

   Please note that this is just an informal test tool to OOjREW Agent. With this tool, 
   users don't need to start Mule server to test OOjREW Agent. This tool just acts as a 
   query sender, and will not get the response. Users have to check the logs of OOjREW Agents 
   to find whether it runs normally or not. 

   Please deploy it to your web application server and access it with the "Internet Explore" 
   browser (It currently doesn't work with Firefox now). 
   You will get the execution log of OOjDREW agent under the directory "%TOMCAT/logs/stdout_XXX.log%".
